# CS 250 – Sprint Review and Retrospective

## Artifact Description
This artifact is my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle course. It demonstrates how Agile and Scrum methodologies were applied to the SNHU Travel project to deliver iterative value, improve communication, and adapt to change.

## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by thinking about what the user wants to accomplish and the problem they are trying to solve. Writing user stories keeps development focused on value—it defines features from the user’s perspective with clear acceptance criteria. This helps me turn abstract requests into concrete, testable goals.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development iteratively, using Agile practices like sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives to continuously improve. Agile allows me to deliver functional software early and refine it based on feedback. In future work, I’ll continue using Scrum principles, incremental delivery, and collaboration tools like JIRA or GitHub Projects to manage progress.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, being reliable, and supporting others when they’re blocked. It’s about collaboration over competition—sharing knowledge, listening, and adapting. In Agile teams, good members help maintain transparency and accountability so that everyone succeeds together.
